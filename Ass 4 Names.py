# This program is designed to take five names
# It will then format those names as last name then first name
# And finally print a nice list of those names

# This is how to put in a name
name = input("Please enter your list of names: ");

# Then split each name into a list
name_list = name.split('-')

# Then format everything
for x in name_list:
    # Finally, make the output last name, first name
    word = variable.split()

    # And then give a way of choosing your names!
    variable1 = word[0]
    variable2 = word[1]

    # Print outputs
    print(variable2, variable1[0], ".")
